# Description

Flipkart is a leading e-commerce website in India, and in this project we made functional clone of Flipkart.com with optimized code along with HTML-CSS. we have added user interactions like sign up and log in pages and our project is easier to understand beacuse of same as original website and use of more functions in Javascript code. Due to time limit we have completed our project in one week but in future we are looking forward to add more functionalities to make it more accessible and user friendly.
